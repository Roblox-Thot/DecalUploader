# DecalUploader
Simple mass Roblox decal uploader


# Required modules
`lxml`, `requests`, and `BeautifulSoup`

# How to use
1. Put `main.py` in a folder
2. Make a `files` folder next to `main.py`
3. Run `main.py` and wait for it to stop
4. All decal links will be in Out.txt next to `main.py`

# Note
This will not work on <13 accounts as I don't care to add support for them and they just seem to error right now 🤷‍♀️

# Credits to some DevForum post for a good chunk of this code lmao
